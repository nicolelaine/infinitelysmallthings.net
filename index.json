For this project, we stage parties to remix presidential candidates’ speeches into limericks. We call these “quantitative political poetry parties” or QPPPs.\nAt the QPPPs, we write limericks, talk politics, and share information. By remixing candidates’ top words and phrases on the campaign trail we produce limericks about politics, campaigning and the political process that were never spoken outright (but maybe should have been).\nAnyone can stage a QPPP using our kit. We have had parties in Des Moines, Boston and Hartford. Mostly liberals have staged them and the left is currently winning the limerick war.\nThe best limericks have been realized as data visualizations in an exhibition space at the Harvard Center for American Political Studies.

This particular stretch of wall represented divides the Tohono O’odham Nation—the second largest Native American reservation in the country—into two parts. It was erected in 2007 by Homeland Security.\nAn information board in front of the wall asked passersby “border questions” like: Are you a citizen? What color are you? Where are you going? Participants were able to text their responses to the project website. In front of the border, a large circular vent in the ground played the Eagle Song, a traditional song sung by Tohono O’odham elder Ofelia Rivas. How does the international border in Arizona touch all of our lives, despite it being seemingly far away from a college campus in New England? What happens when we divide a territory that the community imagines as contiguous? We may imagine that the border is far away in a remote desert, but if the border can cross the Tohono O’odham Nation, then the border can also cross us. This installation was produced in collaboration with Ofelia Rivas, a Tohono O’odham elder. A delegation of Tohono O’odham, including Rivas and several youth traveled to campus to speak about their experience. In addition, the Native American Studies Certificate Program in the Anthropology Department held a panel discussion on Borders \u0026amp; Indigenous Sovereignty as part of the campus’ annual Native American Powwow.\nThe fence ran between a parking garage and the campus center. Over the course of two weeks it served as a provocation, a touchstone for conversation, and a site for talks and performances. Along with the fence’s insertion into daily life on campus, the project invited a delegation of Tohono O’odham, including a tribal elder and several youth to speak about their experience. In addition, the Native American Studies Certificate Program in the Anthropology Department held a panel discussion on Borders \u0026amp; Indigenous Sovereignty as part of the campus’ annual Native American Powwow. Border issues affect several other tribes, including the Mohawk and Abenaki. The delegation of O’odham spoke along with others about these issues during the conference and participate in the powwow.\nLead Artist # Catherine D’Ignazio\nExhibitions # “The Border Crossed Us.” UMass Amherst.

A young man named several places after his friends because “they deserve it.” A five-year-old renamed Dana Park to Monkey Park because “I like monkeys.” People renamed neighborhoods to recall past histories (i.e. renaming Area 4 to Candyland to commemorate Necco and Squirrel candy companies). One woman renamed Harvard Street to Ann Radcliffe Street because, she said, Radcliffe gave all the money to found Harvard and never got any street out of it.\nFinally, money was attached money to the renaming process.

Sasha a.k.a Member of the Institute for Infinitely Small Things] was invited to represent Upgrade! Boston at the 3rd Upgrade! International: Chain Reaction, Skopje, Macedonia; September 11-14, 2008. There, he performed How Do You Take Your Coffee?/Kakvu piješ kafu?, a public action in Skopje’s Old Bazaar. The Institute hopes to expand this performance to a series of actions in Montenegro.\nWe were told by an arts funding agency that they did not see how this was art, hence they could not fund it. Nevertheless, we still want to do the project.\nThe Institute, along with Montenegrin group Creative Cluster propose to hold public coffee time – kafenisanje – at sites that do not exist anymore. For example: in the parking lot of a gas station that used to be an Institute member’s childhood home. Anyone who would like to have coffee with us is welcome. We would use kafenisanje as a public forum for dialogue about place, development and local changes.\nPodgorica, Montenegro, is an Eastern European capital undergoing rapid changes: names of public spaces, branding, architecture, and demographics. Entire sections of the city are being razed to the ground and rebuilt as “better” and more “modern”. The flow of capital and the growth in population are unprecedented. Media and public institutions bombard the public with terms such as: “international”, “European”, “modern”, “developed”, “financial and cultural center of Montenegro”. Although “transparency” is another word of the day, decision-making power is concentrated in the hands of a few people who have political, financial and international connections.\nWhat is happening to history and what new histories are being created right now? In order to research these questions, The Institute for Infinitely Small Things (USA) and Creative Cluster (Montenegro) propose How Do You Take Your Coffee?/ KAKVU PIJEŠ KAFU? as a series of five public performances in five different places in Podgorica over the course of ten days. Each performance will last 3-4 h and will be based on the Montenegrin custom of social coffee drinking (kafenisanje). Traditionally, each coffee is made individually to suit personal taste. This requires time commitment from both the hosts and the guests. At each performance, the artists, their guests and members of the general public will enjoy kafenisanje and share personal stories of the place, common histories as well as thoughts about the future.\nSite is extremely important to this project. Each performance will take place at a different social or domestic space that was changed recently and erased from the maps (for example, Savic Rasovic’s childhood home is now a gas station and a local graveyard is now a soccer stadium). In commemorating what once was, we are acknowledging and pointing out what is often neglected. We will question the notion of “better” and “development” and raise issues that are not being talked about openly or are neglected by a financially developing city. These conversations will also serve as a catalyst for raising awareness of other places in the city that underwent or are undergoing a similar fate.\nAll the performances will be videotaped and documented. This documentation will be freely available online at the project’s website. The cost of internet in Montenegro is quite high and due to a humble amount of internet users in Podgorica we hope to reach more people through print.\nThe ultimate goal of the project is to produce a coffee-table book which could be freely distributed to libraries, participants, museums, schools, city offices, bookstores, and art groups in Podgorica.\nDonate to the Project # Donate ","date":"14 September 2008","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/works/how-do-you-take-your-coffee/","section":"Our Work","summary":"","title":"How do you take your coffee? / Kakvu Piješ Kafu?","type":"works"},{"content":"Members of the Institute for Infinitely Small Things took on the role of laborers at the Institute of Contemporary Art Boston as part of the programming for the exhibition The World as a Stage.

The results were published as a video research report. Unmarked Packages was also part of a gallery show at Gallery 400 at the University of Illinois at Chicago in a exhibition called Pathogeographies.\nThe Unmarked Package, along with the Unattended Bag, has achieved an interesting status in the “War on Terror” and in actual reported events that evoke fear and insecurity around the nation. Announcements around the USA tell us to watch out for unmarked packages and unattended bags. The terrorists could be anywhere, they tell us and we must be constantly vigilant in our public spaces.\nIn May 2007, the Institute for Infinitely Small Things used a mobile sculpture of hundreds of Unmarked Packages to interview people in Chicago, IL, about fear and insecurity in public places. We traversed seven neighborhoods and used multiple forms of transportation. The video showcases the results.\nPhoto Slideshow # Previous Nextsads ","date":"18 July 2007","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/works/unmarked-package/","section":"Our Work","summary":"","title":"Unmarked Package - A Case for Feeling Insecure","type":"works"},{"content":"The Institute was commissioned to do a work for a public video screen in Harvard Square, an outdoor mall in Cambridge, MA. The resulting work is a video guidebook for tourists in Harvard Square which instructs them in 57 things they can do for fun, leisure and entertainment without spending any money.\nThe piece is silent, as Harvard Square is a very loud area. It ran on the LumenEclipse video screens in March, 2006.\nPhoto Slideshow # Previous Nextsads ","date":"25 October 2005","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/works/57-things-to-do-for-free-in-harvard-square/","section":"Our Work","summary":"","title":"57 Things to do for Free in Harvard Square","type":"works"},{"content":"Every day for 11 days, the Institute/iKatun chose to perform an instruction submitted by collaborators from around the world via the project website. 100(11) Instruction Works was part of the 7a*11d International Performance Art Festival in Toronto, Canada, October 2004.\nThis project invited people from around the world to upload instructions for actions in public spaces. Each day, a small group of collaborators (iKatun members and members of the public) would set out from the InterAccess Electronic Arts space to complete one performance. We created an algorithm to walk through the city so that we would end up performing in a different place each day. The algorithm would tell us to go 5 blocks straight, 3 blocks right and so on. If there was a building, fence, private residence or other obstruction in the way, we had to scale it or walk through it.\nThe performances included strange actions (slithering on the ground) and interactions with strangers (hugging them, carrying them, polling them about performance art). Some performances were quiet and others were more spectacular.\nAt the end of each day, the video documentation from the performance was screened at InterAccess Electronic Arts Center.\nPhoto Slideshow # Previous Nextsads ","date":"25 November 2004","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/works/10011-instruction-works/","section":"Our Work","summary":"","title":"100(11) Instruction Works","type":"works"},{"content":"The Institute for Infinitely Small Things conducts creative, participatory research that aims to temporarily transform public spaces and instigate dialogue about democracy, spatial justice and everyday life.
