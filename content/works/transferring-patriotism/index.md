*(proposed)*

The Institute for Infinitely Small Things is selling its patriotism to any interested buyers. Once the sale is made, the full transfer of our patriotism to you will occur via a performance. This can only occur if both parties are fully intoxicated.

The full transfer of our patriotism to you will occur in the following way:

Two members of the Institute will fly to your country. We will meet you and a witness from your country at the border between your country and the US Embassy or Consulate. We will set up a table with four chairs. We will sit at half of the table on American territory and you will sit at half of the table on your country’s territory. We will then proceed to share an American beer. Then we will share a drink from your country. We will repeat those drinks until we are all drunk. At that point, the transfer of patriotism will be complete.

Price: Cost of two plane tickets from Boston, MA, USA, to your country plus additional logistic costs.

All sales for this work are negotiated through the gallery Evolution de l’Art, a collaboration between SPACE (Juraj Carny, Diana Majdakova and Lydia Pribisova) and Cesare Pietroiusti.
