## A meditation on the datafication of the sky.

*In collaboration with The Institute for Infinitely Small Things*

iSkyTV is an Interactive web artwork by the Institute for Infinitely Small Things with Sophia Brueckner. It was supported by an award from Turbulence.org.

iSkyTV detects the user's location and animates the Google Street View sky above their heads. The project is a reimagining of SkyTV, Yoko Ono's famed video work from 1966 where she had a live video feed of the sky into a gallery space. iSkyTV uses Google's database to reflect on the ways in which our experience of the environment, landscape, and natural resources have been digitized, databased, copyrighted and archived. Note the Google logo all over the sky.
