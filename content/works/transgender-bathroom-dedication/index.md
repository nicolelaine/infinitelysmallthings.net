Transgender Bathroom Dedication dedicates the men’s room at the MFA Boston to Dean Spade who was arrested in 2002 for using the men’s room in Grand Central Station and dedicates the women’s room at the MFA Boston to Chrissy Pollis who was the victim of a transgender hate crime in a Maryland bathroom in May 2011.

These two new works are gifts to the MFA Boston on behalf of the Institute for Infinitely Small Things. They were emplaced as part of “Boston’s Best 40-ennial”, a 19-minute historical and totally unauthorized exhibition in the bathroom of the MFA Boston organized by Greg Cook on June 20th, 2011.
