Zamboanga Have IV was a six-day workshop taught at Western Mindanao State University by the Institute for Infinitely Small Things. 

The Institute and sixty students from Western Mindanao State University conducted investigations together, using the Institute's past findings about fear, public messaging, borders and instruction-based performance. 

Confined to an enclosed beach resort and the university campus, the Institute conducted the workshops using a mix of in-person activities and remote SMS-based excursions with the students as they worked in the field of the city. The Institute experienced these places through the eyes of the workshop participants, and in turn the participants saw their surroundings in new and different ways. 

Zamboanga Have IV was the fourth and final installment of Zamboanga Hace, or Zamboanga Does, a four-part cycle of workshops organized over the last few years by the Manila-based group the Office for Culture and Design. Each year has seen a different artist teach at Western Mindanao State University; the Institute is the first and only lab-coat-wearing collective to jump in so far.
