Every day for 11 days, the Institute/iKatun chose to perform an instruction submitted by collaborators from around the world via the project website. 100(11) Instruction Works was part of the 7a*11d International Performance Art Festival in Toronto, Canada, October 2004. 

This project invited people from around the world to upload instructions for actions in public spaces. Each day, a small group of collaborators (iKatun members and members of the public) would set out from the InterAccess Electronic Arts space to complete one performance. We created an algorithm to walk through the city so that we would end up performing in a different place each day. The algorithm would tell us to go 5 blocks straight, 3 blocks right and so on. If there was a building, fence, private residence or other obstruction in the way, we had to scale it or walk through it.

The performances included strange actions (slithering on the ground) and interactions with strangers (hugging them, carrying them, polling them about performance art). Some performances were quiet and others were more spectacular.

At the end of each day, the video documentation from the performance was screened at InterAccess Electronic Arts Center.
