In May 2018, the Institute for Infinitely Small Things had several works exhibited at Roppongi Art Night in Tokyo. On display were several projects: the [City Formerly Known as Cambridge](/works/the-city-formerly-known-as-cambridge), [57 Things to Do for Free in Harvard Square](/works/57-things-to-do-for-free-in-harvard-square), and our [Corporate Commands](/works/corporate-commands) cards & performances.

While the show was only up for six days, it had an astounding number of visitors â€“ some 14,000, in fact. We believe this is due to the popularity of Roppongi Art Night, though some unnamed Institute members would like to believe it is because of their international status and worldwide charisma.

The show was curated by Hiroko Kikuchi and Akio Hayashi of [Invisible.Tokyo](https://invisible.tokyo/) and also included works by the [National Bitter Melon Council](https://www.andisutton.net/post-is-a-post).
