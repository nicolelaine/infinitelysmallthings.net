On Sunday, October 1, 2011 the Institute joined with [Occupy Boston](https://www.occupyboston.org/) in the 6th HONK! Parade to carry signs with two messages: “NO ONE HAS YET DETERMINED WHAT THE BODY CAN DO” and “#OCCUPYBOSTON”. The former is a quote from the philosopher Spinoza.

At 7AM Thursday, October 6 2011 the Institute strung banners over a Boston highway with the same messages. This was done as part of the multi-city Afghanistan War Tenth Anniversary Banners project.
