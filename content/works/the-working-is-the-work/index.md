Members of the Institute for Infinitely Small Things took on the role of laborers at the Institute of Contemporary Art Boston as part of the programming for the exhibition The World as a Stage. The regular workers went on a paid break while the Institute took over jobs such as cleaning, cafe table bussing, elevator operating, gallery watching, performance ushering and people counting.

The title of the piece is borrowed from Mierle Laderman Ukelesâ€™ [Maintenance Art Manifesto](https://queensmuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ukeles-Manifesto-for-Maintenance-Art-1969.pdf).
