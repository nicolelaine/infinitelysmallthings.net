In April 2011, The Institute for Infinitely Small Things sent out an open invitation to discuss failed processes and failed projects. Consisting of 5-7 minute presentations by the Institute and invited participants, the event addressed the ways in which failures can and cannot be currently discussed in the world–and how we may be able to imagine to new ways to perceive, view and characterize what “failure” is.
