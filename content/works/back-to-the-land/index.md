Back to the Land was a post-apocalyptic picnic blanket by the Institute for Infinitely Small Things with Aleta Deyo and Mikhail Mansion.

We played for one day in a hot-pink, ten-person, collaborative, electronic eco-garment. Our visual senses were transformed with pink and our aural senses with sensors and electronic music. It happened on Sat Aug 4th, 12-3PM, 2012, at the DeCordova Museum and Sculpture Park, Lincoln, MA.

This collaboration between performers, costume designers, and electronics wizards will outfit the DeCordova Sculpture Park in a giant hot-pink cloak that invites you in to become one with the land, providing a unique experience as you contemplate your place in nature.
